Given an int n, return True if it is within 10 of 100 or 200. Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.


near_hundred(93) → True
near_hundred(90) → True
near_hundred(89) → False

def near_hundred(n):


This question suggests 
the integer n needs to be within 10 to 100 or 10 to 200.

if n is less than 100 then it can not be less than 10,
if n is more than 10 then it can not be either 100 or 200. 

pseudo code:
1. deduct n from 100 or 200.
2. if the remaining number is more than 10, returns false.
3. 100 - 89(n) = 11
